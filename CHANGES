JS/CC: A LALR(1) Parser Generator written in JavaScript
~~~ CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES IN THE LATEST VERSION ~~~

[+] New feature
[-] Bugfix

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.32 (build Dec 29, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Rewritten parser drivers with new Parser Control
	Block and integrated line- and column-calculation
	within the lexical analyzer. This is for testing
	now only!

	Yet tested parser drivers:
	+ Rhino
	+ Spidermonkey
	+ WebEnv

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.31 (build Dec 16, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Extended control on lexical analysis; Using the
	regular expression matching rules, the lexer's
	behavior can now be modified at recognition time,
	by simply using a "continue" to continune lexical
	analysis on the next tokens, or optionally a
	"break", to stop the lexer and return the currently
	matched token. 
	The whitespace-symbol is now declared deprecated
	with this new possibility.
[+] Improved error reporting in JS/CC, now with
	line numbers and filename
[+] New error resynchronization token, which is simply
	the tilde-symbol '~'; It can be used to defined
	error resynchronization rules that are entered
	when parse errors occur, to continue the parse at
	a lower level within the grammar
[+] Rewritten error recovery in all parser drivers,
	using an error token instead of panic-mode
	error recovery

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.30 (build Nov 24, 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------
[-] Bugfix with whitespaces symbol

[+] JS/CC is now maintained and continued under Linux,
	the Windows version will continue to be supported
[+] Completely rewritten build-system optimized for

	+ Spidermonkey version under *nix
	+ V8 version under *nix
	+ WebEnv version, maintained under *nix
	+ JScript version, both for Windows Script Host and

	running successfully, no output is generated to
	stdout/stderr.

	build-system, fixed some mistakes

-------------------------------------------------------
