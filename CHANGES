[+] New feature
[-] Bugfix

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.36 (not officially released)
-------------------------------------------------------
Changes the licensing terms from Artistic License
version 1.0 to 3-clause BSD-open source license, in
order to become more interesting for other open source
projects. The development on JS/CC has been deceased
since the last few years by the core-developers.

Any help on the project, also a new project maintenance
would be highly appreciated!

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.35 (not officially released)
-------------------------------------------------------
Inserted many changes and improvement contributions
written by Sergiy Shatunov. This is a testing stage
only, there will be many greater changes also in
future.

WARNING:
This version is under heavy development, and defines
a snapshot used for several revision processes.
Not all features will work properly or had been
tested!

[+] Changed all "new Array()", "new Object()" and
	"new String()" calls into a syntax-specified format
[+] Added create_constructor function for creating copy
	constructors for types used in code
[+] Replaced bitset-Functions with a new BitSet type
	(Constructor+Prototype)
[+] Moved parser function, debug functions and data
	into (function(){...})(); block
[+] Moved some of generated parts of data and code
	outside lexer and parser functions
[+] Added json2.js for support on Mozilla platforms
	(Rhino/Spidermonkey)
[+] Added nodejs platform

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.34 (formerly called 0.33.1, not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Rewritten style of parser template generation,
	so it is not required anymore to maintain five
	single parser templates; The logic is now general,
	and input/output functions are implemented for
	all platforms in its own file.

	You can find the new parser generation system in
	jscc/src/driver

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.33 (not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Adds a new feature "default production" for testing
	purposes into JS/CC. This feature allows for better
	error reporting and recovery, because on wrong
	tokens, the parsers will continue reducing until a
	final shift is required - and this invokes error
	recovery and reporting.

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.32 (build Dec 29, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Rewritten parser drivers with new Parser Control
	Block and integrated line- and column-calculation
	within the lexical analyzer. This is for testing
	now only!

	Yet tested parser drivers:
	+ Rhino
	+ Spidermonkey
	+ WebEnv

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.31 (build Dec 16, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Extended control on lexical analysis; Using the
	regular expression matching rules, the lexer's
	behavior can now be modified at recognition time,
	by simply using a "continue" to continune lexical
	analysis on the next tokens, or optionally a
	"break", to stop the lexer and return the currently
	matched token.
	The whitespace-symbol is now declared deprecated
	with this new possibility.
[+] Improved error reporting in JS/CC, now with
	line numbers and filename
[+] New error resynchronization token, which is simply
	the tilde-symbol '~'; It can be used to defined
	error resynchronization rules that are entered
	when parse errors occur, to continue the parse at
	a lower level within the grammar
[+] Rewritten error recovery in all parser drivers,
	using an error token instead of panic-mode
	error recovery

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.30 (build Nov 24, 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------
[-] Bugfix with whitespaces symbol
[-] Bugfix with nonassociative symbols, it works now!
[+] Source directory cleaned up

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.29 (build Nov 17, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Support for Google's V8 JavaScript Engine added
[+] Support for Mozilla/Spidermonkey smjs scripting
	shell added.
[+] JS/CC is now maintained and continued under Linux,
	the Windows version will continue to be supported
[+] Completely rewritten build-system optimized for
	GNU make:
	+ Rhino version under *nix
	+ Spidermonkey version under *nix
	+ V8 version under *nix
	+ WebEnv version, maintained under *nix
	+ JScript version, both for Windows Script Host and
	  JScript.NET for Windows
[+] JS/CC command-line version is now behaving more
	*nix-like: Lesser output of information; When
	running successfully, no output is generated to
	stdout/stderr.
[+] Several changes in the manual coming with the new
	build-system, fixed some mistakes

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.28 (build Aug 25, 2008 - not released)
-------------------------------------------------------
[-] Bugfix in FIRST-set computation: Nullable
	nonterminals produced wrong FIRST-sets in some
	special cases. Is now solved, for beta.

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.27 (build Aug 22, 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------
[-] Bugfix in terminal semantic action codes:
	%offset hold a wrong value (the offset behind the
	token!)
[-] The placeholder %source in terminal semantic action
	codes was not implemented, but mentioned in the
	manual!

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.27 (build Jun 23, 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------
[+] Visual parse tree construction in web environment
[+] Zoom-in parser and generator outputs in web
	environment for better readability
[+] Some design improovements in web environment
[-] Bugfix solved in regular expression matching,
	a lot of thanks to Radim Cebis

-------------------------------------------------------
JS/CC v0.26 (build Feb 18, 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------
[-] Some extensions on the manual
[-] Now with updated jsccr.js for Rhino
	(the first v0.26 release came with a v0.25 compile
