JS/CC: A LALR(1) Parser Generator written in JavaScript
~~~ TODO LIST (PAST LESSONS, FUTURE THEORIES :D) ~~~

-------------------------------------------------------
Priority        Description
1=low, 3=high
-------------------------------------------------------
3				Remove lexer generator and use
				JavaScript's build-in regex implemen-
				tation. Sergiy has found out a method
				how to implement this in an object-
				oriented aspect.
3				Rewrite the Web Environment; It is
				currently only optimized for a screen
				resolution of 2048x1024 pixels, and
				should be rewritten using a web frame-
				work or better web standards.

2               More examples required; Nothing has
                changed here since the first release
                of JS/CC, v0.24, which is over one year
                ago!

2               Command-line improvements, e.g.
                making command-line parameters more
                easier to use, e.g. platform option
                instead of template file.

2               Improvements on the grammar definition
                language to be more yacc-compliant
                and easier to use.

1               Syntax-highlighting in Web Environment
                (there is a project which allows this,
                but it's GNU GPL, and can't be combined
                with JS/CC's Artistic License).
