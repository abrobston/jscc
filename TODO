JS/CC: A LALR(1) Parser Generator written in JavaScript
~~~ TODO LIST (PAST LESSONS, FUTURE THEORIES :D) ~~~

-------------------------------------------------------
Priority        Description
1=low, 3=high
-------------------------------------------------------
3               More examples required; Nothing has
                changed here since the first release
                of JS/CC, v0.24, which is over one year
                ago!

2               Command-line improvements, e.g.
                making command-line parameters more
                easier to use, e.g. platform option
                instead of template file.

2               The current error reporting is a stub;
                This must be improved soon!

2               Improvements on the grammar definition
                language to be more yacc-compliant
                and easier to use.

2               Launching a derivative of JS/CC
                featuring a full-compatible lex and
                yacc-styled toolchain for ECMAScript
                platforms.

2               JS/CC Web Environment improovements:
                - XHTML/CSS validation required
                - Support for Opera, Safari and
                  Konqueror
				  
1               Syntax-highlighting in Web Environment
                (there is a project which allows this,
                but it's GNU GPL, and can't be combined
                with JS/CC's Artistic License).
				
1               Port to even more, ECMAScript-enabled
                platforms.
