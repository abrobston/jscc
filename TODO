JS/CC: A LALR(1) Parser Generator written in JavaScript
~~~ TODO LIST (PAST LESSONS, FUTURE THEORIES :D) ~~~

-------------------------------------------------------
Priority        Description
1=low, 3=high
-------------------------------------------------------
3               More examples required; Nothing has
                changed here since the first release
                of JS/CC, v0.24, which is over one year
                ago!

3				Improving the Web Environment; It is
				currently only optimized for a screen
				resoltion of 2048x1024 pixels. There
				need also be found some ways of re-
				positioning the different debug- and
				output areas in a more simpler and
				space-saving manner.

2               JS/CC Web Environment improovements:
                - XHTML/CSS validation required
                - Support for Opera, Safari and
                  Konqueror

2               Command-line improvements, e.g.
                making command-line parameters more
                easier to use, e.g. platform option
                instead of template file.

2               Improvements on the grammar definition
                language to be more yacc-compliant
                and easier to use.

2               Launching a derivative of JS/CC
                featuring a full-compatible lex and
                yacc-styled toolchain for ECMAScript
                platforms, based on JS/CC.

1               Syntax-highlighting in Web Environment
                (there is a project which allows this,
                but it's GNU GPL, and can't be combined
                with JS/CC's Artistic License).
				
1               Port to even more, ECMAScript-enabled
                platforms.
